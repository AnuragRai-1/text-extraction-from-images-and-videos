# Slides-Extraction-from-Video
It observed that sometimes we need all the slides used in any video, so i decided to make a Machine Learning model with python which will take video file as input and returns a pdf file contains all the slides used in that particular video,so to do that i used FFMPEG tool to get images from video and further did data cleaning as i only needs those images which are slides (not contains face of lecturer and also removal of redundant images) using face recognition and text extraction from image.Also in addition I generated video transcript of lecture using speech to text (Machine learning).I have learned lot from this project about Machine learning ,FFMPEG and ML algorithms.
